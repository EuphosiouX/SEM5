Number 1: robot-in-a-room-qlearning.py
Number 2: acrobot-qlearning.py and frozen-lake-qlearning.py

For robot in a room and acrobot code,
I implement it by using your example code

For frozen lake code,
I reference it from
https://github.com/Apiquet/Reinforcement_learning/blob/main/q_learning/qlearning_FrozenLake.ipynb
